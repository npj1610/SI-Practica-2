The `2dPoints.py` file in /src/h1 is a small program to edit test data sets for Adaboost:

The data set has 2 dimensions with values ranging from 0 to 255 (actually 5 to 252 due to the bad interface). There are three classes (red circle, blue cross and green triangle) to assign to each data point. Click on any of the right-side images and add a point of that class by clicking inside the diagram. You can easily add new classes by editing the code and adding an image.
